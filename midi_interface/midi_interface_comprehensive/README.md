# Comprehansive MIDI Implementation
All you need to interface MIDI input to your audio synthesis  
pipeline!  
  
  
Should be mostly compliant with MIDI standards, if something  
critical is missing please let me know!  
  
  
## Interface
Unless you intend to properly implement optocoupling, one can  
create their own input circuitry or drive the iCE40 from a TTL  
MIDI-UART stream. An example of this output is provided in  
(insert github link here)
